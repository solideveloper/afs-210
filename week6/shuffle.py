# Python provides a built-in method called random.shuffle that will shuffle the list data type.  Do not use this.
# For this assignment, you are to create your own shuffle algorithm that will take as input a sorted list and randomly shuffle the items before returning the list.  Try to make your algorithm as efficient as possible.
# Add a comment to your code stating what the time complexity of your algorithm is and why.
# Display list before and after shuffle.  Call your shuffle function multiple times, each time on the original sorted list to show the random order of the list items.

# fisher yates algorithm - O(n) time complexity because i'm not creating a copy of the list to shuffle through it. 
# instead i'm modifying the list in place or at a 'constant space' making it O(n)
# swapping the last item with a random -not previously selected- item and repeating until all items in list have been selected
